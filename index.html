					<p>At the heart of our party lies a fundamental convinction that: we shall use government as a force for good and a source of 
					hope.  That Americans must not only be free, but they live in a fair and free society - where the elderly and the disabled 
					can lead lives of dignity. Where social security, education and healthcare insurance remains an unshakable committment to all. 
					Where strong national defense is a common "American" effort. And promoting human rights because the basic value of our govt.</p>

					<h2>Our society will be:</h2>
					<p>One where all Americans can find jobs in a growing "full-employment" economy. Where workers are guaranteed the legal right to 
					join unions of their own choosing and to bargain collectively for decent wages and decent conditions of employment. A society 
					where taxes are clearly based on ones ability to pay. Where the strengthening of the family and the protection of the children 
					are essential to the health of our nation. We will make a healthy environment possible for every single citizen.</p>

					the constitutional rights and the civil rights of minorities are fully secured, an no one is denied their natural rights and the 
					opportunity to a better life. A society where both public and private discrimination based upon race, sex, age, color, creed, national 
					origin, religion, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, gender identity, economic status, philisophoical persuasion or physical disability
					are condemned and government moves aggressively to end such discrimination through lawful means.</p>
